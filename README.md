You are in charge of a major travel agency in the United States of America. Your agency doesn’t have its own airline, therefore you assign travelers to flights based on their wishes and budget. As of late, you have started receiving many complaints about delayed and cancelled flights. The bookings are rolling in for next summer holiday period (August 2022) and you decide to roll up your sleeves and develop a machine learning model to predict the amount of delay a particular flight will experience. To this end, you start looking for data and you stumble upon a dataset which provides information on all known delays in the months March, April, May, June and July of 2019. Moreover, you find the flight schedule for August of 2022! You can therefore use the 2019 data in order to predict the amount of delay flights will be experiencing next summer!


This assignment is by no means straightforward and should contain at least the following steps:

• Exploratory data analysis: Is the data clean? What data do we really need to use? What
factors are more/less important? Can you visualize the data?

• Determine a good performance measure that can be used to evaluate your machine learning
model.

• Split the known data into a train/test set and start developing models. Try out many models
in order to obtain good predictions on the test set.

In total there are 4 separate files:
• historic_data.csv : containing the labeled data for March, April, May, June and July of 2019.
• future_data.csv : containing the unlabeled data for August 2022.
• airlines.csv : containing the full names of airlines which appear in the data.
• airports.csv : containing additional information for the airports which occur in the data.
